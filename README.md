### Inspiration

I wanted to create a macropad that allowed to use macros and work more efficiently. I created a macropad using 4 switches, 1 oled, 1 encoder, and 6 leds. 

### Challenges

This was my first time using Kicad! It ended up taking a lot of time and asking for help on slack but I'm pretty proud of the final product. I had the most struggle figuring out how to make footprints work, it took me a while to get the hang of it.
